Design of OpenMP-based Parallel [Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA)] for [community detection], \
with no internally-disconnected communities.

Community detection is the problem of identifying tightly connected clusters of nodes within a network. Efficient parallel algorithms for this play a crucial role in various applications, especially as datasets expand to significant sizes. The Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) is commonly employed for this purpose due to its ease of parallelization, rapid execution, and scalability. However, it may yield internally disconnected communities. This technical report introduces GSL-LPA, derived from our parallelization of LPA, namely GVE-LPA. Our experiments on a system with two 16-core Intel Xeon Gold 6226R processors show that GSL-LPA not only mitigates this issue but also surpasses FLPA, igraph LPA, and NetworKit LPA by `55x`, `10,300x`, and `5.8x`, respectively, achieving a processing rate of `844M` edges/s on a `3.8B` edge graph. Additionally, GSL-LPA scales at a rate of `1.6x` for every doubling of threads.

Below we plot the time taken by [FLPA], [igraph] LPA, [NetworKit] LPA, and GSL-LPA on 13 different graphs. GSL-LPA surpasses FLPA, igraph LPA, and NetworKit LPA by `55√ó`, `10,300√ó`, and `5.8√ó` respectively, achieving a processing rate of `844M` edges/s on a `3.8ùêµ` edge graph.

Below we plot the speedup of GSL-LPA wrt FLPA, igraph LPA, and NetworKit LPA.

Next, we plot the modularity of communities identified by FLPA, igraph LPA, NetworKit LPA, and GSL-LPA. GSL-LPA on average obtains `7.1%` / `0.7%` higher modularity than FLPA and igraph LPA respectively (especially on road networks and protein k-mer graphs), and `3.6%` lower modularity than NetworKit LPA (especially on protein k-mer graphs).

Finally, we plot the fraction of disconnected communities identified by each implementation. Absence of bars indicates the absence of disconnected communities. GSL-LPA does not identify any communities that are internally-disconnected. However, on average, FLPA, igraph LPA, and NetworKit LPA exhibit fraction of disconnected communities amounting to `2.3√ó10^‚àí3`, `1.2√ó10^‚àí3`, and `1.8√ó10^‚àí2`, particularly on web graphs and social networks.
