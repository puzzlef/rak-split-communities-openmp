Multi-threaded OpenMP-based [Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA)], aka RAK, for [community detection].

In recent years, there has been an unprecedented increase in data collection, and their representation as graphs. Thus, there is a demand for efficient parallel algorithms designed to identify communities in large networks. The significance of the multicore/shared memory environment in this context is crucial, both due to its energy efficiency, and due to widespread availability of hardware with large memory capacities. Existing research on Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) focuses on algorithmic optimizations and parallelization but lacks exploration of efficient data structures for selecting the most weighted label. Furthermore, the proposed techniques are dispersed across multiple papers, making it challenging for readers to grasp and implement them effectively. To address this, we introduce **GVE-LPA**, an optimized *parallel implementation of LPA* for shared memory multicores.

Below we plot the time taken by [FLPA], [igraph] LPA, [NetworKit] LPA, and GVE-LPA on 13 different graphs. GVE-LPA surpasses FLPA, igraph LPA, and NetworKit LPA by `118,000×`, `97,000×`, and `40×` respectively, achieving a processing rate of `1.4𝐵` edges/s on a `3.8𝐵` edge graph.

Below we plot the speedup of GVE-LPA wrt FLPA, igraph LPA, and NetworKit LPA.

Next, we plot the modularity of communities identified by FLPA, igraph LPA, NetworKit LPA, and GVE-LPA. GVE-LPA on average obtains `0.6%` / `0.2%` higher modularity than FLPA and igraph LPA respectively (especially on web graphs), and `4.1%` lower modularity than NetworKit LPA (especially on protein k-mer graphs with large number of
vertices and a low average degree).

Finally, we plot the strong scaling behaviour of GVE-LPA. With doubling of threads, GVE-LPA exhibits an average performance scaling of `1.7×`.
